### This project is about building webpage that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. NLP is the ability of an application to understand the human language, written or oral.

### And it uses an external api called "Aylien" to interact with their NLP system. This tool will help us classify the information available in the article, like whether the content is subjective (opinion) or objective (fact-based) and whether it is positive, neutral, or negative in tone.
